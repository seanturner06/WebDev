# Homework 0: Thoughts on Ungrading

## 1. What are your thoughts on the Ungrading practice as it applies in general to teaching and learning (not necessarily specifically to this class)?

I think it is a good practice because it allows more creativity and less stress for the student. It should be effective because the student can focus less on getting a good grade and more on actually learning the material. A lot of students learn in such a way that instead of learning and retaining the material, they do what they need to do to get a good grade and forget a substanstial amount of the material. It is to be noted that Ungrading is potentially dangerous when there aren't any measures of learning, self-evaluation, or accountability.  

## 2. What are your thoughts on the way Ungrading will be applied to this class based on what has been explained by your instructor and what is described in the syllabus?

I think how Ungrading will be applied in this class will be very usedful, not only for this class, but how we learn can be applied in the future for other endeavors. I think the use of determining whether or not you are meeting expections, not meeting expectations, or exceeding expectations on assignments is an effective requirement because no one wants to be subpar, so it will force us to be critical with our own work. The idea of self-evalution works very good for those who are ethical, and for those who aren't, they will learn to be because of the consequences. I believe the Ungrading system will work well especially for those who are very harsh on themselves. Having constructive feedback on work will motivate students to work harder and I believe it establishes a strong relationship between the professor/TA's and the student.
